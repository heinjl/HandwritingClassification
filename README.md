The main program is located in the Program/ folder.
Run 'python main.py' in the Program directory
You may need to run the install.sh script. I
HIGHLY recommend checking its contents before 
running it. In particular, the pygame installation
depends on your operating system. 

Most of the other files are just for reference. 

I sincerely apologize for the c code. I had not written
any significant c program before this one. The circular
dependencies are particularly bad. -James
